# Personal Considerations
This project was developed following the React Starter Classes tutorial from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/starter). The main goal of this project is to introduce the ReactJS syntax by developing a fully work application. This was my second time using ReactJS but the first time following an instructor, which made the process a lot easier. At the end of the project I was excited with the possibilities of what can be build with ReactJS and I'm looking foward to learn more about it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
